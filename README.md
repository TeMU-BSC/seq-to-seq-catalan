# Sequence-to-sequence Resources for Catalan

In this work, we introduce sequence-to-sequence language resources for Catalan, a moderately under-resourced language, towards two tasks, namely: Summarization and Machine Translation (MT). We present two new summarization datasets in the domain of newswire. We also introduce a parallel Catalan to English corpus, paired with three different brand new test sets. Finally, we evaluate the data presented with competing state of the art models, and we develop baselines for these tasks using a newly created Catalan BART. We release the resulting resources of this work under open license to encourage the development of language technology in Catalan.
